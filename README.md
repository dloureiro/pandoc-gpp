# pandoc-gpp

`pandoc-gpp` is a wrapper aroung `pandoc` and `gpp` allowing pandoc users who want to go from markdown to pdf/html to :

 * include files
 * add missing features : underline, color
 * include code directly
 * include images with specific ratio
 * include graphs
 * include tables based on csv files

The code is still evolving to cope with different type of limitations of the markdown specifications.

# Limitations

`pandoc-gpp` is able to manage only `markdown` input files and `html` and `pdf` output files.
